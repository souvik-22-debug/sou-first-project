# sou-first-project
This is my first GitHub repository where I am learning how to use GitHub, manage code, and understand version control. This project will contain basic programs, practice files, and small experiments as I explore coding.
# My First GitHub Repository

Welcome to my first GitHub project!  
This repository is created to help me learn how GitHub works — from creating repositories to uploading code, writing commits, and understanding version control.

## What You Will Find Here
- Basic coding practice files  
- Simple programs I write while learning  
- Experiments and mini-projects  
- Notes about Git, GitHub, and programming

## Why I Made This Repo
I created this repository to:
- Improve my coding skills  
- Learn Git commands and GitHub workflow  
- Track my progress  
- Build a habit of uploading projects regularly  

## Technologies Used
- Python / C / JavaScript (depending on what you upload)
- Git & GitHub  
- VS Code (optional)

## Future Goals
- Upload more structured projects  
- Learn branches, pull requests, and collaboration  
- Build larger applications step-by-step
